    <p>
    Since 1954 the Choreography (<a href="http://flybyfoy.com/services/">Aereography</a>) for Peter Pan The Musical has remained relatively consistent. While each production and each <a href="http://www.zfxflying.com/about/whats-a-flying-director/">Flying Director</a> brings their own <strong>flair</strong> to the production, the basic movements are based entirely on the version created by the father of Theatrical Flying Effects, <a href="http://flybyfoy.com/about/history/">Peter Foy</a>.<br>

    <h2>...Lovely Wonderful Thoughts... (The Set)</h2>

    <p>
      The Nursery is the scene of the main flying event. Because of this, and the consistent structure of the Aereography, all Nursery sets must contain a few <i>Key Elements</i>.
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>Window</strong> without a top located Upstage Center</li>
          <li>A <strong>Fireplace Mantle</strong> located downstage near directly below the Flying equipment</li>
          <li>Another <strong>Structural</strong> object located opposite the mantle</li>
        </ul>  
        With these pieces (plus any additional pieces needed for the scene) you can create the basic structure of the standard flying effect for "I'm Flying", which introduces Peter Pan's magical ability to the audience and concludes the first Act. (The big number)

    <h2>...And UP YOU GO! (The Aereography)</h2>
    <p>To simplify the explanation of the movements, we will make a few assumptions:
      <ul>
        <li>The Mantle is on Stage Right</li>
        <li>There is a bed on Stage Left</li>
        <li>There are no obstructions between the mantle and the bed</li>
      </ul>
      Here is a brief description of the steps per sequence of "I'm Flying". The Cue line is numbered and it's steps sub-listed:
      <ol>
        <li>..And <strong>up</strong> you go</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Peter goes straight up and waits a beat</li>
            <li>Travels away from the Mantle until the Start of the song</li>
            <li>Some number of passes back and forth to land on "..Trying"</li>
          </ul>
        <li>High <strong>Up</strong> and as light...</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Peter goes up by some alternative means (climbing a ladder or swimming up) on 3 "bumps"</li>
            <li>Travel away form mantle and make some number of passes (depending on the size of the stage)</li>
            <li>Land on bed on the line "..way up off the ground."</li>
          </ul>
        <li>I <strong>Fly</strong> and I'm...</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Peter leaps from Bed to Mantle</li>
            <li>Magical Lean off Mantle and back to standing</li>
          </ul>
        <li>I'm <strong>Flying!</strong> Over bed over chair...</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Some number of passes (depending on stage)</li>
            <li>Land on stage off of center</li>
          </ul>
      </ol>
    This concludes the "I'm Flying" song. After this song, Pan blows fairy dust and the children and teaches the kids to fly. The Act concludes with Peter, Wendy, Michael, and John all flying while the set is cleared in view.

    <p> For more information on Peter Foy and the History of How Peter Pan The Musical changed the face visit <a href="http://flybyfoy.com">Flying By Foy</a>. This website has a very Simple structure with defined classes per block. The information on this site is good but its overall CSS seems very old standard. In seeing how this, and other websites, structure using <code> < div class="" ></code>, I've used a similar structure to help with any future CSS added to the page. <br>For a video example of the Aereogrphy, you can watch<a href="https://youtu.be/wnKnoznYHAg?t=2073">Some Random High School</a> perform nearly identical movements as done 60 years ago.
